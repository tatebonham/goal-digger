## Stretch Goals

- See other peoples profiles with their added bucket list goals
- Be able to favorite other's bucket list goals and add that to the users own profile list
- Be able to leave comments on goals

## Tech Stack
- MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js)
- Axios
- CSS: combination of vanilla CSS and React Bootstrap
- HTML 
- API : https://api-ninjas.com/api/bucketlist - you will need to register for an API key

## Deployment Instructions
1. Fork and clone repository 
2. In your terminal run <npm install>  (this will install all needed packages)
3. You will want to install a couple of files for functionality
    - In  your terminal touch <.git.ignore> and <.env>
    - To your git ignore file add: node_modules and .env
    - In your .env file you will need to add an ENC_KEY and your API key 
        -ex: ENC_KEY = "super secret password string"
        - We highly recommend placing your API key on the server end
4. Run NPM start and start your coding 

## Post Project Reflection
- This project was our teams first time working on a group development project. We feel we have grown and learned a lot about collaboration. We have had some challenges (we're looking at you Git Hub) but we created a project we are all proud of. 
- Collaboration Strategies: we used a spreadsheet to plan out our project and assign individual tasks. We also communicated via Slack to ensure we were all on the same page
- Challenges and takeaways: One of the bigest challenges we faced was not deviating from our assigned tasks. When working on a solo project you tend to hop back and forth between files and change things. It is not advisable in a group project to do that.  Another of our challenges was managing the work flow of Git hub when working with a team. We had a lot of merge issues and misunderstanding of the neccessary steps but by the end of the project we had the process down.
- Future Plans: we would like to add functionality for users to see other users bucket list items, as well as update the styling- Giant shoutout to Megan for her awesome CSS.
